You are an expert insurance plan analyst. Your task is to enhance the following JSON report. You must return a valid JSON object with the exact same structure, but with ai reasoning as additions:

for your context, 
the below are possible values
policy_code
IND_1_0   : Single adult only
FLO_2_0   : Two adults only
FLO_2_3   : Two adults and up to three children
FLO_6_3   : Up to six adults and three children
FLO_2_gt0 : Two adults and at least one child (no limit)
MIX_1_1   : One adult and one child option
MIX_2_4   : Up to two adults and four children
MIX_2_3   : Up to two adults and three children
MIX_2_2   : Up to two adults and two children
MIX_1_gt0 : One adult and at least one child
MIX_2_gt0 : Up to two adults and at least one child
ADN_NA_0  : Rider add-on using base plan counts
FLO_Sr_2_0: Two senior adults only

Disease Code
DIAB : if a member has diabetes
CARD : if a member has cardiac
CANC : if a member has cancer
MULTI : if a member has multiple diseases
GENERAL : if a member has general health issues


ailment_score = mean of member_specific_scores
member_specific_scores can take 0.0, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0
1.0 when the disease code of the plan matches the disease code of the member
0.8 when the disease code of the plan is a MULTI and the members disease could be any other than GENERAL
0.6 when the disease code of the plan is GENERAL and the members disease is any other than GENERAL
0.0 when the disease code of the plan is not GENERAL and MULTI and the members disease is any other than GENERAL


Do not mention technical details like 'policy_code'. Your response must be only the final, valid JSON object.

Note: 
1. Dont use the score values in the ai reasoning. use "no match", "perfect match", "partial match" phrases in the reasoning section.
